<p><img src="images/reichhousenov2017.png" alt="" id="staircase"/>Reich House is an old treasure in the city of Aberdeen MS. It was built circa 1902 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. She stands tall and proud on a slight hill on S Franklin Street. The home was originally built by Walter S Carlton and his wife Claudia Harrison Carlton. Their family name is proudly engraved in the cement at the entrance of the steps on the street. Walter Carlton was a prominent politician and business owner in Aberdeen. He was an Alderman for 25 years and was a Selectman. He is among the names engraved on the cornerstone of Aberdeen City Hall. Mr Carlton died in the house on October 27th, 1936. His wife passed in June 1944. Both their funerals were conducted in the house - an obvious sign that the house was so important them.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="images/staircase1.jpg" alt="" id="seanceroom1"/>My name is Reich - the new owner of the house. When I first viewed the home, I had planned to have a simple bed and breakfast. While viewing it, I could feel a presence. When entering the grand dining room, I felt inspired. The inspiration continued after I had left the house. It was much like a message. The message was that my plans should revolve around the grand dining room. It should be used as a seance room to contact those who have passed into the spirit world.
</p> 
<p>I welcome you to come to Reich House and see what you experience. Clairvoyants, channelers, mediums, paranormal investigators, and the rest of the public are very welcome to visit. Reich House will soon be open as a guest house giving people a chance to spend the night in a paranormally active house. I am also available for seances. Please contact me for an appointment. The house is also available for meetings or events. For more information, call (415) 23-REICH or mail me at contact@reich.cf
